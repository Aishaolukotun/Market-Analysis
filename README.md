# Market-Analysis
Project Description

An online national clothing chain needs help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they donâ€™t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
Shirt: $25
Sweater: $100
Leather Bag: $1,000
They need analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.

This analysis aims to solve the problems and help the company achieve their goal.
